<!-- Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter the total purchase amount 
and then calculates the discount based on the following criteria:
If the amount is greater than $100, a discount of 10% is applied.
If the amount is between $50 and $100, a discount of 5% is applied.
If the amount is less than $50, no discount is applied.
